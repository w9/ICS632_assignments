Introduction
============

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a dimensional reduction
algorithm that has been widely used in the bioinformatics field in recent years
[1-5]. It's unique ability to help visualize the complex spatial relationships
between high-dimensional points (vectors) makes it suitable for the
state-of-the-art next generation sequencing technologies. t-SNE has also been
popular in other fields that have high-dimensional data, the most well-known
example being the "deep-learning" research community [6-8].

The key idea of t-SNE is Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE). For each pair of
points $x_i$ and $x_j$, the *similarity* between $x_i$ and $x_j$ is defined as
the conditional probability at $x_j$, if we set a Gaussian distribution centered
at $x_i$. This conditional probability, denoted as $p_{j|i}$, is given by

  $$p_{j|i} = \frac{\exp (-\text{dist}^2(x_i, x_j) / 2 \sigma^2)}{\exp (\sum_{k \ne i}-\text{dist}^2(x_i, x_j) / 2 \sigma^2)}$$
